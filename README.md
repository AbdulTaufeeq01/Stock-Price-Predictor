# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

A **web-based application** for predicting future stock prices using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network implemented in **PyTorch**. The app fetches historical stock data, computes **technical indicators** (Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, and Relative Strength Index), trains an LSTM model, and visualizes predictions using an interactive **Plotly** graph. Built with **Streamlit** for a clean and intuitive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- 📉 **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- 📊 **Technical Indicators**: Computes 20-day and 50-day **SMA/EMA**, and 14-day **RSI** to enhance model predictions.
- 🧠 **LSTM Model**: Implements a PyTorch-based LSTM for time series forecasting.
- 📈 **Interactive Visualization**: Displays historical and predicted prices with **Plotly** in a dynamic graph.
- 🧪 **User Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** – input a stock ticker, select days to predict, choose to retrain model.
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Catches and informs users of issues like empty data or invalid tickers.

## 🛠 Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-predictor.git
cd stock-price-predictor
```
### 2.**Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4.  **Run the Application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## 📈 Usage
Open the app in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

Enter a valid stock ticker (e.g., AAPL).

Select number of days to predict (1 to 30).

Check "Retrain Model" to retrain the LSTM or uncheck to reuse the previous model (if caching is implemented).

Click "Predict" to start.

## 🔍 Output
A table showing the predicted closing prices.

A Plotly line graph with:

Last 60 days of actual closing prices

Predicted values for the next n days

A vertical line marking the start of prediction

## 📊 Example Output Table (7-day prediction)
Day	Predicted Price (USD)
Day 1	219.16
Day 2	218.90
Day 3	218.40
Day 4	217.78
Day 5	217.12
Day 6	216.47
Day 7	215.86

## ⚙️ How It Works
Data Download
Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.

Feature Engineering
Calculates:

20 & 50-day SMA

20 & 50-day EMA

14-day RSI

Data Scaling
Applies MinMaxScaler to normalize features like Close, SMA, EMA, RSI.

Sequence Creation
Uses a 60-day lookback window to create sequences for training.

Model Training
Trains a 3-layer PyTorch LSTM with 100 hidden units.

Prediction
Predicts the next n days using a loop (recursive strategy).

Inverse Transformation
Converts scaled predictions back to the original price range.

Visualization
Combines recent real prices and predicted prices in a single interactive Plotly graph.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting
MultiIndex Errors
Make sure the DataFrame from yfinance does not have MultiIndex columns. Use .reset_index() if needed.

Empty DataFrame
Happens with invalid tickers or network issues. Try tickers like AAPL, GOOG, MSFT.

Plotly Not Rendering
Ensure plotly is installed:
```bash
pip install plotly
```
Model Too Inaccurate?
Increase training epochs in train_model() or enhance feature selection.

Check Debug Logs
Logs will help debug shapes, scaling errors, or prediction failures.
